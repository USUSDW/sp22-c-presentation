# Installation

## LINUX

In order to compile C code, you need to install the GNU Compiler `gcc`.  This should be readily available through your computer's own package manager.

However, on Ubuntu, you can install a few extra tools to allow the build scripts to function by running
`sudo apt-get install build-essentials`

## MAC

On mac, you'll have to install the XCode tools package by running `xcode-select --install`.
Alternatively you may also use the clang compiler, which may already be present on your system.
